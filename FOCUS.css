 * 1. I used the universal selector (*) and a generic "a" selector prior to the focus pseudo-element to insure the styles I declared below are applied to anything that receives focus, and in a consistant manner.
 * 2. Use of !important's ensure conflicts are overridden by FOCUS' styles.
 * 3. To stop the outline from appearing when activating a link in Firefox and IE AND when returning to a page, for those who are peticular to accessibility not messing with design -- like the two are mutualy exclusive.
