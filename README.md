# FOCUS

Help yourself when accessibility testing

## About

What do you do when you are called upon to test a website for accessibility and there isn't even a focus indicator present to indicate what a user, being you, is tabbing through on a page? You implement FOCUS, that what!

Since keyboard accessibility tends to be the baseline to which accessibility is measured, we *need* focus styles. Thankfully all is not lost when you come across a web developers work who has nulled the default focus style of a browser and has forgotten to add their own. That's why browser vendors built a feature called "user defined style sheets".
