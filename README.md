# FOCUS

Indication when surfing with your keyboard

## About

What do you do when you use, or in that rare case are called upon to test a website for accessibility, and there isn't even a focus indicator present to indicate what you are tabbing through on a page? You implement FOCUS, that what!

FOCUS quite simply is a "user defined style sheet". A "user defined style sheet" allows a user to declare a set of "styles" that your web browser will obey above all other styles declared by any web sites creator. Should you require a uniform experience, and I cannot think of a better use case for such a feature than that of focus styles, than you should declare those yourself.

## Usage

This is where things can get a little tricky. Much trickier than when I last attempted to do this. Walking you through the steps necessary to install FOCUS in your browser isn't nearly as simple as it should be. I'll require some time.
